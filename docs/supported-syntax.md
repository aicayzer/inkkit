# Supported Markdown

InkKit supports CommonMark, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks, GFM tables, footnotes and full, collapsed and shortcut reference links. Unresolved references and unsupported constructs remain editable literal source. TXT mode treats every character literally.

## Callouts

The bounded callout set follows [GitHub alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) and selected [Obsidian callout syntax](https://obsidian.md/help/callouts).

| Syntax                                                         | Support                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `> [!NOTE]`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, `CAUTION`          | Editable bodies; type spelling is retained. Types are case-insensitive. |
| `> [!note] Custom title`                                       | Plain-text title on the marker line.                                    |
| `> [!note]+ Custom title`                                      | Initially expanded, keyboard-operable fold control.                     |
| `> [!note]- Custom title`                                      | Initially collapsed, keyboard-operable fold control.                    |
| Other types, spaced or repeated fold markers, formatted titles | Editable literal Markdown.                                              |

Put the body on subsequent quoted lines. Fold markers must directly follow the closing bracket. Enter and Space operate the focused fold button. Folding changes presentation without changing source or dirty state. Ordinary export and printing include the complete body and title without fold controls.

## Highlights

`==highlight==` renders as editable highlighted text. Escaped delimiters and code remain literal. Exactly two delimiters are required; adjacent and nested supported formatting is retained. Ordinary copy provides readable text and semantic `<mark>` HTML. Copy as Markdown retains the source delimiters.

## Comments

Complete HTML `<!--comments-->` and Obsidian `%%comments%%` are editable author content, including inline and multiline comments. They start hidden; hosts can reveal them with `setCommentsVisible(true)`. Markdown snapshots and explicit Markdown copy retain comments. Ordinary text, HTML, clipboard metadata and print omit them even when revealed. Code and TXT remain literal; incomplete comment syntax remains literal. HTML is never executed.

Comment delimiters inside footnote identifiers or link destinations are literal identifier or destination text. They are not author comments. Footnote body comments follow the ordinary comment rules.
